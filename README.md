Advance pattern recognition

This is a project where I implemented **Simple Linear Regression** in Python to predict house prices using the "**King County Housing Dataset**".

## Files in this Project
Linear_Regression_Python.ipynb -> Jupyter Notebook with the code.  
kc_house_data.csv -> Dataset containing house details and prices.  

## What I Did
1. Loaded the dataset.  
2. Selected **sqft_living** as the feature (X) and **price** as the target (Y).  
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.  
4. Trained a Linear Regression model.  
5. Plotted a regression line and tested the predictions.  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook **Linear_Regression_Python.ipynb**.  
2. Run all the cells step by step.  
3. You will see:  
   - A scatter plot with a regression line.  
   - Predicted prices vs actual prices.  

## Example Output
- A graph showing how house price increases with square footage.  
- Model accuracy values (RÂ² score and error).
